After a long period of inactivity of Zaphod and zacaj, I (Keripo)
took diffs of their source code against the official gpSP source
codes and did a proper port of gpSP to the iPodLinux target as
a separate branch/build target. Using Zaphod's original changes,
and studying the iBoy source code, I re-wrote separate iPod-
specific code and added a few iPod-specific tweaks and settings. 
A large chunk of the code is borrowed from various places (see
the comments of the "ipod/ipod_common.h" file.

To set up the source code, extract the original source archive,
copy both the 'ipod' directory and igpSP patch file to the new
'gpsp_src' directory, then apply the igpSP patch. For example,
  tar -xjf gpsp09-2xb_src.tar.bz2
  cp ipod gpsp_src/
  cp igpSP-0.9-2xb-K#.patch gpsp_src/
  cd gpsp_src
  patch -p0 -t -i igpSP-0.9-2xb-K#.patch

To compile the modified source code, type 'make' in the 'ipod'
directory with the 3.4.3 toolchain. Just typing 'make' will
build igpSP with sound. Using 'make NOSOUND=1' will build igpSP
without sound. Using 'make NOSOUND=1 BENCHMARK=1' will enable
benchmarking. See the ipod/Makefile for more information.
For example,
  cd ipod
  export PATH=/usr/local/arm-uclinux-tools2/bin:$PATH
  make NOSOUND=1

Now that you've compiled igpSP, why not contribute back? Look
at the iPod-specific changes and see if you're able to further
optimize the code (use benchtests in stable locations to test
out performance - contact me if you want the ROM and savestate
that I use for benchmarking tests). If you have knowledge of
assembly, try to optimize the assembly output (according to
Exophase, gcc is sometimes "stupid"). If you're very skilled,
you might even be able to optimize the gpSP code itself (such
as the few optimizations from the binary shifts I changed).
The current gpSP version (0.9-2Xb) will be Exophase's last open
source version with the source code of future builds available
only to a few people (including myself). The reason behind the
close-sourcing is due to annoying forks by Takka and the PSP
scene's consequential disrespectful attitudes towards Exophase.
For more information, see Exophase's reply on the GP2X forums:
http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?&showtopic=42302&p=613143&#entry613143
Thus, if you are able to make improvements, please contact
either myself or Exophase where necessary. ; )
